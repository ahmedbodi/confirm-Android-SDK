5    CONFIDENTIALITY

As used herein, “Confidential Information” means, subject to the exceptions set forth in the following sentence, any information or data, regardless of whether it is in tangible form, disclosed by either Party (the “Disclosing Party”) that the Disclosing Party has either marked as confidential or proprietary, or has identified in writing as confidential, or proprietary within thirty (30) days of disclosure to the other Party (the “Receiving Party”); provided, however, that a Disclosing Party’s business plans, strategies, technology, research and development, current and prospective customers, billing records, products, or services shall be deemed Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party even if not so marked or identified. Confirm’s Confidential Information includes, without limitation, the Licensed Technology and the terms of this Agreement.  Customer’s Confidential Information includes, without limitation, the Customer Data (subject to Confirm’s rights under Section 2.1).  Information will not be deemed “Confidential Information” if such information: (a) is known to the Receiving Party prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party directly or indirectly from a source other than one having an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party; (b) becomes known (independently of disclosure by the Disclosing Party) to the Receiving Party directly or indirectly from a source other than one having an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party; or (c) becomes publicly known or otherwise ceases to be secret or confidential, except through a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party.  Each Party agrees that it shall use the Confidential Information of the other Party solely to perform its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement.  Neither Party will disclose, or permit to be disclosed, the other Party’s Confidential Information directly or indirectly, to any third party without the other Party’s prior written consent, except as otherwise permitted hereunder.  Each Party will use reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality and value of the other Party’s Confidential Information.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, either Party may disclose the other Party’s Confidential Information, in whole or in part (i) to its employees, officers, directors, consultants, and professional advisers (e.g., attorneys, auditors, financial advisors, accountants, and other professional representatives) who have a need to know and are legally bound to keep such Confidential Information confidential by confidentiality obligations or, in the case of professional advisors, are bound by ethical duties to keep such Confidential Information confidential consistent with the terms of this Agreement; and (ii) as required by law (in which case each Party shall provide the other with prior written notification thereof, shall provide such Party with the opportunity to contest such disclosure, and shall use its reasonable efforts to minimize such disclosure to the extent permitted by applicable law).  Each Party agrees to exercise due care in protecting the Confidential Information from unauthorized use and disclosure.  In the event of actual or threatened breach of the provisions of this Section, the non-breaching Party will be entitled to seek immediate injunctive and other equitable relief, without waiving any other rights or remedies available to it.  Each Party shall promptly notify the other in writing if it becomes aware of any violations of the confidentiality obligations set forth in this Agreement.

ALL OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUALITY, ACCURACY, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.



7    LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS CUMULATIVE AND NOT PER INCIDENT. 

7.3  Independent Allocations of Risk.  EACH PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS OF THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES.

8    INDEMNIFICATION

8.1  Indemnification by Confirm.  Confirm shall defend Customer and the officers, directors, agents, and employees of Customer (“Customer Indemnified Parties”) against any third party claim, allegation, or legal action (a “Claim”) arising from an allegation that Customer’s authorized use of the Licensed Technology infringes any intellectual property right of a third party. Further, Confirm shall indemnify the Customer Indemnified Party against any damages actually awarded or paid in connection therewith, including any reasonable attorneys’ fees.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confirm’s indemnification obligation will not apply to claims to the extent arising from (a) modification of the Licensed Technology by any party other than Confirm without Confirm’s express consent; (b) the combination, operation, or use of the Licensed Technology with other product(s), data or services where the Licensed Technology would not by itself be infringing; or (c) unauthorized or improper use of the Licensed Technology.  If the use of the Licensed Technology by Customer has become, or in Confirm’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of any claim of infringement, Confirm may at its option and expense (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Licensed Technology as set forth hereunder, (ii) replace or modify the Licensed Technology to make it non-infringing so long as the Licensed Technology has at least equivalent functionality, (iii) substitute an equivalent for the Licensed Technology or (iv) if options (i)-(iv) are not reasonably practicable, terminate this Agreement.  This Section 8.1 states Confirm’s entire obligation and Customer’s sole remedies in connection with any claim regarding the intellectual property rights of any third party.

8.2  Indemnification by Customer.   Customer shall defend Confirm and the officers, directors, agents, and employees of Confirm (“Confirm Indemnified Parties”) against any Claims arising from (a) any use or disclosure by Customer or any Authorized End User of the Licensed Technology in violation of this Agreement or (b) the exercise of any rights granted to Confirm by Customer in or to the Customer Data in accordance with this Agreement.  Further, Customer shall indemnify the Confirm Indemnified Party against any damages actually awarded or paid in connection therewith, including any reasonable attorneys’ fees.  

8.3  Indemnification Procedure. If a Customer Indemnified Party or a Confirm Indemnified Party (each, an “Indemnified Party”) becomes aware of any matter it believes it should be indemnified under Section 8.1 or Section 8.2, as applicable, involving any claim, action, suit, investigation, arbitration or other proceeding against the Indemnified Party by any third party (each an “Action”), the Indemnified Party will give the other Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) prompt written notice of such Action.  The Indemnified Party will cooperate, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the defense and the Indemnified Party will have the right to participate fully, at its own expense, in the defense of such Action with counsel of its own choosing. Any compromise or settlement of an Action will require the prior written consent of both Parties hereunder, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.



9    GENERAL

Customer may not remove or export from the United States or allow the export or re-export of the Licensed Technology or anything related thereto, or any direct product thereof in violation of any restrictions, laws or regulations of the United States Department of Commerce, the United States Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other United States or foreign agency or authority.  If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.  Neither Party may assign this Agreement or assign or delegate its rights or obligations under the Agreement without the other Party’s prior written consent; provided however, that either Party may assign this Agreement to an acquirer of or successor to all or substantially all of its business or assets to which this Agreement relates, whether by merger, sale of assets, sale of stock, reorganization or otherwise.  Any assignment or attempted assignment by either Party otherwise than in accordance with this Section shall be null and void.  Both Parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the Parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and that all waivers and modifications must be in a writing signed by both Parties, except as otherwise provided herein.  In the event of a conflict between the Order and these Terms and Conditions, the terms set forth in the Order shall govern.  No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and a Party does not have any authority of any kind to bind the other Party in any respect whatsoever.  In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing Party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees.  All notices under this Agreement will be in writing and sent to the recipient’s address set forth in the Order and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or email; the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service; and upon receipt, if sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.  Each Party shall be excused from performance for any period during which, and to the extent that, it is prevented from performing any obligation or service, in whole or in part, as a result of a cause beyond its reasonable control and without its fault or negligence, including, but not limited to, acts of God, acts of war, epidemics, fire, communication line failures, power failures, earthquakes, floods, blizzard, or other natural disasters (but excluding failure caused by a Party's financial condition or any internal labor problems (including strikes, lockouts, work stoppages or slowdowns, or the threat thereof)) (a “Force Majeure Event”).  Delays in performing obligations due to a Force Majeure Event shall automatically extend the deadline for performing such obligations for a period equal to the duration of such Force Majeure Event.  Except as otherwise agreed upon by the Parties in writing, in the event such non-performance continues for a period of thirty (30) days or more, either Party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice thereof to the other Party.  Upon the occurrence of any Force Majeure Event, the affected Party shall give the other Party written notice thereof as soon as reasonably practicable of its failure of performance, describing the cause and effect of such failure, and the anticipated duration of its inability to perform. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.  For all disputes relating to this Agreement, each Party submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Boston, Massachusetts and waives any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.  Customer acknowledges that any unauthorized use of the Licensed Technology may cause irreparable harm and injury to Confirm for which there is no adequate remedy at law.  In addition to all other remedies available under this Agreement, at law or in equity, Customer agrees that Confirm may be entitled to injunctive relief in the event Customer uses the Confirm in any way not expressly permitted by this Agreement.
